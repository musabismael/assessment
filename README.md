# Dynamic Form Application

This project is a React-based frontend application that demonstrates the ability to dynamically render UI components based on JSON data, handle API integrations efficiently, implement complex application logic, and use modern libraries like Shadcn UI and TanStack Query.

## Features

1. Dynamic Form Rendering: Renders a form based on JSON configuration fetched from an API.
2. API Integration: Uses TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and mutation.
3. Advanced Logic:
   - Dependent Fields: Shows a "Preferred Contact Method" field when age is greater than 18.
   - Form State Management: Implements a Reset Form button and tracks field interactions.
   - Optimistic Updates: Shows a "Submitting" state immediately when the form is submitted.
4. Validation: Uses Zod for form validation.
5. Error Handling: Displays appropriate error messages for invalid fields.
